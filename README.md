# Floorp-Rounded-Theme
Just a tweaked version of proton ui with rounded corners ;)
Steps to configure the theme:

  1- Download the theme from the Releases section.
  2- Unzip the file and copy the ðŸ‘‰chromeðŸ‘ˆ folder into your Firefox profile directory. To find out the location of your profile directory go to about:support or about:profiles.
  3- Install and use this theme if you want pink colors (you can use other themes btw): https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/catppuccin-mocha-pink/?utm_content=addons-manager-reviews-link&utm_medium=firefox-browser&utm_source=firefox-browser
  4- Restart the browser.
